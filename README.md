Problem Statement:
1.Sentiment Analysis on Yelp Reviews Using LSTM
The task is to design and implement a sentiment analysis model using a Bidirectional LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) network 
to classify text reviews from the Yelp dataset as either positive or negative. The model should predict the sentiment of the review based on the textual content, with two classes:
0: Negative sentiment
1: Positive sentiment

2.The Iris dataset is a well-known dataset containing 150 samples of iris flowers categorized into three species: Setosa, Versicolor, and Virginica. Each sample is represented by four features: Sepal Length Sepal Width Petal Length Petal Width. i)To develop a machine learning model using the Decision tree algorithm to classify iris flowers into their respective species based on sepal and petal dimensions. ii)To develop a machine learning model using the K th cluster algorithm to classify iris flowers into their respective species based on sepal and petal dimensions. iii)To develop a machine learning model using the Random forest algorithm to classify iris flowers into their respective species based on sepal and petal dimensions.

OUTPUT: i) Decision Tree Model Accuracy: 1.00 Prediction for new sample: virginica ii)Predicted Cluster: 0 Prediction for new sample: setosa iii)Random Forest Model Accuracy: 1.00 Prediction for new sample: virginica
